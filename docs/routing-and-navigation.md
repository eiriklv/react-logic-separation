# Routing and Navigation

TODO

Alternatives:

(Choose whether to treat it as an external dependency, or as a first class transitive primitive)

- Either buy in to some default approach, where none of it is mocked, but rather use providers during testing
- Or create some generic abstraction on top, that abstracts away the actual library/implementation, then dependency inject those primitives
